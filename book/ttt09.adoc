= TTT Part 9 of n {longdash} Controlling Processes
include::variables.adoc[]

In the <<ttt08,previous instalment>>, we looked at how Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X represent processes.
We then went on to look at the commands for listing running processes and filtering and sorting them in various ways.
This time we'll move on to controlling processes, specifically starting and stopping them.

== Starting Processes

Whether or not you think of it in this way, you're always starting processes.
Each time you launch an app, you've started a process.
Also, each time you issue a command on the Terminal, you're starting a process.

So far, each time we've started a process from the command shell, it's been a so-called _foreground process_.
We enter the command, this starts a new process, and that new process gets control of our terminal until it finishes, at which time we get returned to the command shell.
When we run very simple commands like `ps` or `ls`, the processes take just milliseconds to run, so we don't really notice that we lose our prompt for a moment while the new process takes charge, does its thing, and then hands control back.

However, sometimes you want to start a process from the command shell, and not have it take control of your Terminal.
A good example might be using a command shell to start a GUI app.
You want the app to start, and to stay running, but you also want your command prompt back!
We can do this using something called a _background process_.
Should that process produce any text output, it will still show in our Terminal window, but as soon as we hit enter we'll have our command prompt back.

Backgrounding a process is actually very easy to do, just add an `&` to the end of the command, and it will start in the background!

Let's illustrate this with a quick example.
For this to work you'll need to be on OS X, have FireFox installed, and have it not be running when we start.

First, let's start FireFox from the Terminal as a regular foreground process:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin
----

You'll see that the FireFox GUI launches as normal and that it outputs some information on what it's doing to the Terminal.
You'll also notice that you have lost your command prompt.
You can hammer the enter key all you want, but you're not getting that command prompt back until the FireFox process exits and hands control back to your command shell.
Go ahead and do that through the GUI as normal.
Notice how the moment FireFox quits you get your command prompt back.

Now, let's start FireFox as a background process:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin &
----

The FireFox GUI will start just like before, and the same debugging information will be displayed in the Terminal window, but this time you just have to hit enter to get your command prompt back.
Firefox is still running, but you have your command prompt back.

If you scroll up you'll see that the very first piece of output when you ran the command was a line consisting of a number in square brackets, followed by another number, something like: `[1] 1714`

The number in square brackets is a counter for the number of background processes the current command shell is running, and the second number is the PID of the new background processes, in this case, FireFox's PID.

[TIP]
====

You can use a command prompt to quickly check your FireFox version number without even having to launch the FireFox GUI with:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --version
----

Also, when you launch FireFox from a command shell you can pass it flags and arguments to alter its behaviour, for a list of valid options run:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -h
----
====


On Unix and Linux it's normal to launch GUI apps from the command line by backgrounding them, and as you can see, it works on the Mac too.
However, the Mac has another, better, way of opening things from the command line that other versions of Linux and Unix don't have: the `open` command.

The best way to think of `open` is as the command-line equivalent of double-clicking something in the Finder.
When you pass `open` one or more files as arguments it will open those files using the default app for their file type. As an added bonus, it will automatically background any apps it starts, so you don't even have to remember the `&`!
Note that if you pass `open` a folder rather than a file it will open the folder in a new Finder window.

A very handy trick is to use `open` to get a Finder window showing the contents of your command shell's present working directory as follows:

[source,shell]
----
open .
----

Another useful tip is to use `open` to quickly view hidden folders in the Finder.
On recent versions of OS X, where the Library folder is hidden, I often use:

[source,shell]
----
open ~/Library
----

As well as opening things with the default app for their type, `open` can also open files or folders with any other app that supports the given type.
The `-a` flag allows you to specify the app the item should be opened with.

I do a lot of Perl programming, and I have two apps installed that I regularly use to edit Perl code.
I have OS X configured to open `.pl` and `.pm` files with https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit[Komodo Edit] by default.
Komodo Edit is a nice free Perl IDE, and I do all my big programming jobs in it.
However, being a big IDE, it's a bit of a hog -- it takes so long to open that it has a splash screen!
So, when I just want to make a quick edit, I prefer to use the light-weight https://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/[Smultron] editor instead.
I can use `open` with the `-a` flag to specify that I want my Perl file opened with Smultron using a command something like:

[source,shell]
----
open my_perl_file.pl -a /Applications/Smultron\ 5.app/
----

Similarly, if I was using a computer that didn't have Smultron installed I could open the Perl file with TextEdit using a command like:

[source,shell]
----
open my_perl_file.pl -a /Applications/TextEdit.app/
----

That's all we really need to know about starting processes, so let's move on to ending them.

== Ending Processes

The command to quit a process is `kill`, which sounds very draconian indeed.
Despite how scary it sounds, you don't have to be overly afraid of it, because if used without flags, all it does is politely ask the process if it would please quit.
In other words, it's the command-line equivalent of
ifndef::backend-pdf[]
 kbd:[{commandkey} + Q]
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-pdf[]
 kbd:[{commandkey} + Q]
endif::[]
 or selecting _Quit_ from an app's menu.

The `kill` command needs at least one argument: the PID of the process you'd like to end.
This is where the `ps` and `top` commands we learned about last time come in very handy (or indeed the Activity Monitor app if you are on a Mac).
Note that you can use kill to end as many processes at once as you like; just keep adding more PIDs as arguments.

Let's work through another example, using FireFox again.
We'll start by opening FireFox and backgrounding it with:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin &
----

Before we can quit FireFox with the `kill` command we need to know its PID.
We can either scroll up and read it from the first line of output or, we can use the `ps` command to get it.
Since we started FireFox from the terminal, it will show up when we use `ps` without any arguments at all.

Once you have the PID you can quit FireFox with (replacing `[the_PID]` with the actual PID of course):

[source,shell]
----
kill [the_PID]
----

You should see FireFox exit, and the next time you hit enter on your Terminal you should see a message telling you that a process you started and backgrounded has ended.

Finding PIDs can be a bit of a pain, so you'll be happy to know that you don't have to!
There is another command for ending processes that uses process names rather than PIDs, it's the even more scary-sounding `killall` command.

For what seems like the millionth time today, let's start FireFox and background it:

[source,shell]
----
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin &
----

Rather than looking up its PID, let's now exit it with the `killall` command:

[source,shell]
----
killall firefox-bin
----

Note that you need to be careful with `killall` because, as its name suggests, it will kill ALL processes with a given name, not just one!

== Dealing with Stubborn Processes

Up until now, we've been polite, and we've used `kill` and `killall` to ask processes to please quit themselves.
When an app crashes or hangs, that won't get you very far.
If the app is so messed up it can't deal with mouse input anymore, it's also not going to respond when `kill` or `killall` politely ask it to stop.

When this happens, it's time to bring out the big guns!
Both `kill` and `killall` take an optional argument `-KILL`, which tells `kill`/`killall` to instruct the OS to terminate the process, rather than asking the process to terminate itself.
**ONLY DO THIS AS A LAST RESORT, YOU CAN LOSE UNSAVED DATA THIS WAY!**

Note that on older Unix systems `killall` didn't exist at all, and `kill` only took numeric arguments.
The old numeric equivalent of `-KILL` is `-9`, and both `kill` and `killall` on OS X (and Linux) will accept this old-fashioned flag as well as the more modern `-KILL`.

Before we finish I want to reiterate how important it is to always try `kill` and `killall` without the `-KILL` option first.
Think of it this way, it's basic good manners to ask the process to please leave before you call the bouncers over to eject it!

== Next Time ...

We'll be revisiting processes again later in the series, but we're done with them for now.

In the next instalment, we'll be taking a look at the built-in manual that comes with every Unix/Linux OS, including Mac OS X.
You don't need a book to tell you what flags or arguments a command expects, or what exactly they mean, you can find it all out right from the command shell, even if it takes a little practice to learn to interpret the information.
