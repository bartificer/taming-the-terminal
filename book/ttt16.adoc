= TTT Part 16 of n {longdash} Crossing the Streams
include::variables.adoc[]

In <<ttt15,the previous instalment>>, we introduced the concepts of streams and looked at how every process has references to three streams as part of their environment -- `STDIN`, `STDOUT` & `STDERR`.
We went on to introduce the concept of operators that manipulate these streams, and we focused on the so-called '`pipe`' operator which connects `STDOUT` in one process to `STDIN` in another, allowing commands to be chained together to perform more complex tasks.
We mentioned the existence of operators for connecting streams to files, and the possibility of streams being merged together, but didn't go into any detail.
Well, that's what we'll be doing in this instalment.

== Turning Files into Streams

So far we've been redirecting the output of one command to the input of another, but we can also use files as the source of our streams using the `<` operator.
The operator works by connecting the content of the file to the right of the operator to `STDIN` in the command to the left of the operator.

As an example, let's use the `wc` command we learned about in the previous instalment to count the number of lines in the standard Unix/Linux hosts file again, but this time, we'll use the `<` operator:

[source,shell]
----
wc -l < /etc/hosts
----

Because the `wc` command can take its input either from `STDIN` or from one or more files passed as arguments, the above command achieves the same things as the command we saw in the previous instalment:

[source,shell]
----
wc -l /etc/hosts
----

The `wc` command is not in any way unusual in this, the vast majority of Unix/Linux commands which operate on text or binary data can accept that data either from `STDIN` or from a file path passed as an argument.
For example, all the following commands we have met before can take their input from `STDIN` rather than by specifying a file path as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
less < /etc/hosts
cat < /etc/hosts
head -3 < /etc/hosts
----

It's easier to just pass paths as arguments through, hence the `<` operator is probably the least-used of the stream redirection operators.
However, just because it's the least-used, doesn't mean it's never needed!
There are some commands that will only accept input via `STDIN`, and for such commands, it's vital to have an understanding of the `<` operator in your command-line toolkit.
In my professional life, the one example I meet regularly is the `mysql` command, which does not take a file path as an argument (Note that MySQL is not installed by default on OS X).
To load an SQL file into a MySQL database from the command line you have to do something like:

[source,shell]
----
mysql -h db_server -u db_username -p db_name < sql_file.sql
----

== Sending Streams to a File

While you're not likely to find yourself using files as input streams very often, you are quite likely to find yourself using files as output streams.
There are two operators which perform this task, and the difference between them is subtle but very important.

The first of these operators is `>`.
This operator directs the output from the command to its left to a *NEW* file at the path specified to its right.
If a file already exists at the specified path, it will be *REPLACED*.
This means that after the command finishes the file will only contain the output from that one command execution.
Because of this overwriting behaviour, always use the `>` operator with great care!

The second of the file output operators is `>>`.
This operates in a very similar way to `>`, directing the output of the command to its left to the file specified to its right, but with one very important difference -- if a file already exists at the specified path it will not be replaced, instead, the new output will be appended to the end of the file.
This makes the `>>` operator much safer, but, it means you cannot easily see which content in the file came from the latest execution of the command.

As a practical example, let's revisit our command for generating random characters from the previous instalment, but this time, rather than outputting the random characters to the terminal, we'll send them to a file:

[source,shell]
----
N=256
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N > random.txt
----

We can verify that we have generated 256 random characters by using the `wc` command with the `-c` flag to get it to count characters:

[source,shell]
----
wc -c random.txt
----

If we re-run the command we can verify that the file still only contains 256 characters because the original version of the file was simply replaced by a new version because we used the `>` operator:

[source,shell]
----
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N > random.txt
wc -c random.txt
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N > random.txt
wc -c random.txt
----

Now let's change things up and generate 8 random characters at a time, but append them to a file with the `>>` operator:

[source,shell]
----
N=8
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N >> randomAccumulator.txt
----

As before we can verify the amount of characters in the file using:

[source,shell]
----
wc -c randomAccumulator.txt
----

Now, each time we repeat the command we will add 8 more characters to the file rather than replacing its contents each time:

[source,shell]
----
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N >> randomAccumulator.txt
wc -c randomAccumulator.txt
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N >> randomAccumulator.txt
wc -c randomAccumulator.txt
----

== Redirecting Streams Other Than `STDIN` & `STDOUT`

So far we have always operated on `STDIN` and `STDOUT`.
This is true for our use of all four of the operators we've met so far (`|`, `<`, `>` & `>>`).
However, there is often a need to control other streams, particularly `STDERR`.

Unfortunately, we now have no choice but to take a look at some rather deep Unix/Linux internals.
We've already learned that each process has a reference to three streams within its environment which we've been calling by their Englishy names `STDIN`, `STDOUT` & `STDERR`.
We now need to remove this abstraction.
What the process's environment actually contains is something called a "`File Descriptor Table`", which contains a numbered table of streams.
Three of these streams are created by default, and always present, but processes can add as many more streams as they wish.
Within the file descriptor table, all streams are referenced by number, rather than with nice Englishy names, and the numbers start counting from zero.
To make use of the file descriptor table, we need to know the following mappings:

|===
| File Descriptor | Maps to

| `0`
| `STDIN`

| `1`
| `STDOUT`

| `2`
| `STDERR`
|===

If we were to define our own streams, the first stream we defined would get the file descriptor `3`, the next one `4` and so on.
We are not going to be defining our own streams in this series, so all we have to remember is the contents of the small table above.

We can use the numbers in the file descriptor table in conjunction with the `<`, `>` & `>>` operators to specify which streams the files should be connected to.
For example, we could re-write the examples from today as follows:

[source,shell]
----
wc -l 0< /etc/hosts
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N 1> random.txt
head -c $N /dev/random | base64 | head -c $N 1>> randomAccumulator.txt
----

Since these operators use `0` and `1` by default, you'd never write the above commands with the ``0``s and ``1``s included, but, you have to use the file descriptor table to redirect `STDERR`.

Let's revisit the command we used to intentionally trigger output to `STDERR` in the previous instalment:

[source,shell]
----
ls -l ~/DesktopDONKEY | wc -l
----

This command tries to count the files in a non-existent folder.
Because the folder does not exist, the `ls` command writes nothing to `STDOUT`.
Because the `|` only operates on `STDOUT` the `wc` command counts zero lines, and the error message which was written to `STDERR` is printed to the screen.
We could now redirect the error message to a file as follows:

[source,shell]
----
ls -l ~/DesktopDONKEY 2> error.txt | wc -l
cat error.txt
----

Note that we have to redirect `STDERR` before the `|` operator, otherwise we would be redirecting `STDERR` from the `wc` command rather than the `ls` command.

== Multiple Redirects

You can use multiple redirects in the one command.
For example, you could use one redirect to send data from a file to a command, and another redirect the send the output to a different file.
This is not something you'll see very often, but again, it's something MySQL command-line users will know well, where this is a common construct:

[source,shell]
----
mysql -h db_server -u db_username -p db_name < query.sql > query_result.tab
----

You might also want to send `STDOUT` to one file, and `STDERR` to a different file:

[source,shell]
----
ls -l ~/DesktopDONKEY 2> error.txt | wc -l > fileCount.txt
----

== Crossing the Streams

Unlike in the Ghostbusters universe, in the Unix/Linux universe, it's often desirable to cross the streams -- i.e.
to merge two streams together.
The most common reason to do this is to gather all output, regular and error, into a single stream for writing to a file.
The way this is usually done is to divert `STDERR` to `STDOUT` and then redirect `STDOUT` to a file.

In order to construct a meaningful example, let's preview a command we're going to be returning to in great detail in a future instalment, the `find` command.
This command often writes to both `STDOUT` and `STDERR` during normal operation.

As its name suggests, the `find` command can be used to search for files that meet certain criteria.
If you run the command as a regular user and ask it to search your entire hard drive or a system folder, it will run into a lot of permission errors interspersed with the regular output as the OS prevents it from searching some protected system folders.
As a simple example, let's use find to search for `.pkg` files in the system library folder:

[source,shell]
----
find /Library -name *.pkg
----

Almost straight away you'll see a mix of permission errors and files with the `.pkg` extension.
The key point is that there is a mix of errors and results.
If we try to capture all the output with the command below we'll see that the error messages are not sent to the file, instead, they are sent to our screen (as expected):

[source,shell]
----
find /Library -name *.pkg > findOutput.txt
cat findOutput.txt
----

As we've just learned, we could send the errors to one file and the files to another with:

[source,shell]
----
find /Library -name *.pkg > findOutput.txt 2> findErrors.txt
cat findOutput.txt
cat findErrors.txt
----

But how could we capture all the output together?

To do this we need to introduce one more operator, the `&` operator.
This operator allows a file descriptor table entry to be used in place of a file path by the `<`, `>` & `>>` operator.
Hence, we can redirect `STDERR` (`2`) to `STDOUT` (`1`) as follows:

[source,shell]
----
find /Library -name *.pkg 2>&1
----

This has no noticeable effect until you send `STDOUT` to a file, then you can see that we have indeed diverted `STDERR` to `STDOUT`, and the combined stream to a file:

[source,shell]
----
find /Library -name *.pkg > findCombinedOutput.txt 2>&1
cat findCombinedOutput.txt
----

*IMPORTANT:* notice the counter-intuitive ordering of the above command, although the redirect happens first, it MUST be specified at the end of the command or it will not work.

There is much much more than can be done with streams, but, this is all most people are likely to need in their day-to-day life on the command line, so we'll stop here before we confuse everyone too much 🙂

== Conclusions

We have now seen how streams, and a process's file descriptor table, can be manipulated using the stream redirection commands to chain commands together and funnel input and output to and from files in a very flexible way.
This ability to manipulate streams opens up a whole new world to us, allowing us to build up complex commands from simple commands.
This ability to chain commands is a pre-requisite for our next topic -- searching at the command line.
