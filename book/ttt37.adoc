include::variables.adoc[]

Since we covered SSH in parts <<ttt29,29>> & <<ttt30,30>>, Apple has changed how their desktop OS deals with the passphrases protecting SSH identities (key pairs).
This provides us with a good opportunity to have a look at the SSH Agent in general, and, how things have changed on the Mac in particular.

The good news is that while things have changed on the Mac, with a small amount of effort, you can get back all the convenience and security you had before.

[#Revision_SSH_Identities]
== Revision {longdash} SSH Identities

As a quick reminder -- SSH can authenticate users in many ways.
The two most common are passwords, and so-called _SSH identities_ (sometimes referred to as _SSH keys_).
An SSH identity consists of a private key, a matching public key, and some metadata.
The two keys are stored in separate files, and the name of the file containing the public key must be identical to the one for the private key, but with `.pub` appended to it.
When SSH config files or commands require the path to an identity, what they're looking for is the path to the private key's file.
SSH identities are created using the `ssh-keygen` command.

SSH has the concept of a default identity.
Wherever an identity can be used, SSH will check a number of pre-defined file paths (in a pre-defined order) for a valid identity file, and use the first one it finds.
Today, using the most modern versions of SSH and the default key algorithms, that effectively means that your default identity is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

As with any cryptographic system based on public & private keys, your security completely depends on keeping the private key secret, and the publication of your public key has no impact on your security at all.
That means that the half of the identity that doesn't end in `.pub` is the crown jewels, and you are free to share the half that does end in `.pub` freely.

No sysadmin should ever ask you for your private key; they should only ever need your public key.
If you want to be granted access to a computer, you give the person who manages that computer your public key, they grant access to that key, and you can then log on from the computer that had the matching private key.

To protect your private key, SSH identity files support passphrase-based encryption.
The actual values stored in the files can be the result of encrypting the private key with a passphrase.
The ssh-keygen command will allow you to set a blank password on an identity, but it very much encourages you not to do that, and to set a good, secure passphrase.

If you follow best practice and do indeed set a passphrase on your identity, SSH will prompt you for that passphrase whenever it needs the private key part of that identity.
This gets very tedious very quickly, and that's where the SSH Agent comes in.

[#SSH_Agents]
== SSH Agents

The SSH Agent's _raison d'être_ is to take the pain out of using passphrase-protected SSH identities.
SSH Agents securely cache the decrypted private keys belonging to SSH identities.
SSH Agent processes are generally not shared between users. In fact, they're generally not even shared between login sessions.
When I log into my Mac, a new SSH Agent is automatically started, and that specific SSH Agent is only accessible by apps or commands that I start within that login session.
SSH Agents don't store anything permanently -- they forget everything as soon as they stop running, and logging out will kill the SSH Agent associated with a specific login session.

The core SSH libraries are aware of SSH Agents and can communicate with them, so the caching they provide is available to all the SSH-related terminal commands like `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, as well as to any GUI apps footnote:[Allison and I recommended an app called SSH Shell during the matching podcast episode for this blog post, but it has been replaced by Core Shell: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/core-shell/id1354319581] that make use of the appropriate SSH APIs, for example, both Transmit and SequelPro have SSH Agent support.

The exact mechanisms for configuring an SSH Agent to automatically start and stop on login and logout varies from OS to OS, but many desktop Unix/Linux flavours start SSH Agents by default.
Apple has done so on the Mac since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.
If you're not a Mac user you'll need to do a little Googling to figure out what the state of play is on your particular OS.
Note that there are even SSH Agent implementations for Windows.
You can use https://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] to run OpenSSH's SSH Agent, or, you can use `pageant.exe`, an SSH Agent from the people behind the venerable https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[PuTTY SSH client].

[#It8217s_All_About_the_ssh-add_Command]
=== It's All About the `ssh-add` Command

On Linux/Unix systems (including Apple's OSes), the SSH Agent is provided by the command `ssh-agent`, but that's not the command you use to interact with your particular SSH Agent.
Instead, all your interaction with your SSH Agent will be via the command `ssh-add`.

Firstly, you can check that you actually have a running SSH Agent associated with your login using the `-l` flag (for list).
If you do have a running SSH Agent you'll either see a list of loaded identities or, a message like the following:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.
$
----

If no SSH Agent is running you'll get an error message something like:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
$ ssh-add -l
Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
$
----

[#Loading_Identities_into_an_SSH_Agent]
=== Loading Identities into an SSH Agent

You can load your default identity (generally `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) into your SSH agent with the command:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-add
----

And, you can add a specific identity with the `-a` flag, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-add -a ~/some_ssh_identity_file
----

Note that you will be asked to enter the passphrase for each identity as you load it.

Once you have one or more identities loaded into your SSH Agent you should see them when you run `ssh-add` with the `-l` flag:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
$ ssh-add -l
2048 SHA256:UNP5g9KBBOfqi2RYrtY2aGILNbcvp2pe23+38Ignvsc /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
$
----

[#Removing_Identities_from_an_SSH_Agent]
=== Removing Identities from an SSH Agent

Counter-intuitively, you also use the `ssh-add` command to remove identities from your SSH Agent.
You can remove just your default identity by passing only the `-d` flag:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
$ ssh-add -d
Identity removed: /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa (bart@localhost)
$
----

You can remove other identities by passing the path to the file representing the identity in question as an argument after the `-d` flag, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-add -d ~/some_ssh_identity_file
----

You can also remove all identities at once with the `-D` flag:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
$ ssh-add -D
All identities removed.
$
----

[#SSH_Agent_on_macOS]
== SSH Agent on macOS (and Mac OS X)

_**Update -- February 2021:** this section has been completely re-written to better reflect the current state of play on the Mac._

Since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Apple has integrated SSH Agents into their OS.
When you log in to a Mac, you'll find an SSH Agent running and ready to accept identities.

=== SSH Agents and the Keychain

One of the Mac's core security technologies is the Keychain. Each user account has a Keychain associated with it, and those Keychains securely store sensitive data like passwords and private keys. Keychains are encrypted files, the contents of which can only be accessed through the operating system. The keychain's encryption key is secured with the user's password, and by default, when the a user logs into their Mac their password is used to simultaneously unlock their Keychain, allowing the OS to securely share passwords with apps the user runs.

Since Apple added support for SSH Agents they have also customised the version of the SSH Agent that runs on the Mac to integrate it with the Keychain. While we've had this integration all along, the change from Mac OS X to macOS brought with it a dramatic change in how SSH Agents behave by default, and specifically, how they interact with the Keychain by default.

In Mac OS X the integration with the Keychain was always on, and each time a passphrase was needed for an SSH identity the OS popped up a password prompt in a separate window, and that window had a checkbox to let you store the password in the Keychain. If you checked that box, then from that point forward you would never be prompted for the password again, SSH would always read the passphrase from the Keychain without any user interaction.

What was happening under the hood is that when you logged into your Mac an SSH Agent was started for you, and all SSH passwords found in the Keychain were automatically loaded into that SSH Agent.

This behaviour was very convenient, but also very non-standard, it's simply not how SSH Agents behave on other platforms.

When Apple released macOS 10.12 Sierra, they changed their SSH Agent's default behaviour to bring it into line with its behaviour eleswhere.

Apple did not remove the integration with the Keychain, they simply stopped the SSH Agent sharing passwords with the Keychain by default. Unless you explicitly ask it to, your SSH Agent won't read passwords from the Keychain, or, write passwords to the Keychain. It can still do both of those things, but only when you tell it to!

=== Apple's Custom `ssh-add` Flags

To integrate with the Keychain Apple has added two flags to the `ssh-add` command — `-K` and `-A`.

The `-K` flag effectively means _'and on the keychain too'_ — if you use `ssh-add -K` to load your default identity into your SSH Agent the passphrase will also get copied into your Keychain. If you want to remove a identity and its passphrase from both your Agent and the keychain use the `-K` flag along with the `-d` flag (for delete).

You can load your default SSH identity into your SSH Agent and copy it into your Keychain with the simple command:

[source,console?prompt=%]
----
% ssh-add -K
Enter passphrase for /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Identity added: /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa)
% 
----

You can similarly add other identities by adding their file paths to the command above, e.g. `ssh-add -K some_identity`.

[TIP]
.View SSH Identities in Keychain
====
You can see the SSH identities stored in your keychain by opening the **Keychain Access** app (in **Applications** → **Utilities**) and searching for ssh. Identities will be listed as the path to the private key pre-fixed with `SSH:`, e.g. my SSH identity is in my Keychain as `SSH: /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa`.
====

To remove your default identity from your Keychain (and your SSH Agent), use the `-d` and `-K` flags with the path to your default identity. Note that you  can _cuddle_ the flags, so for me the command is:

[source,console?prompt=%]
----
% ssh-add -dK /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa 
Identity removed: /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa (bart@bartmac.local)
% 
----

Note that you have to remove identities from the Keychain one-by-one, you can's use the `-K` flag in conjunction with the `-D` (delete all) flag.

So, we use the `-K` flag to send changes to the Keychain, how do we read identities from the keychain? That's what the `-A` flag is for — it loads *all* SSH identities found in your Keychain into your SSH Agent'. The flag requires no arguments, so loading SSH identities into your SSH Agent from your Keychain is as simple as:

[source,console]
----
ssh-add -A
----

=== Start Using your Keychain for your SSH Identity

To start using your Keychain for your SSH identity you'll need to load it into your Keychain with:

[source,console]
----
ssh-add -K
----

You only have to do that once — your identity has been permanently added to your Keychain.

[NOTE]
.SSH Identites on Multiple Macs
====
If you have multiple Macs and have iCloud Keychain enabled, the passphrases for your SSH Keys will synchronise to all your Macs. For this to work reliably you should use the same SSH identity on all your Macs.
====

To use the passphrase now stored in your keychain, simply run `ssh-add -A` once before using SSH to load the passphrase for your identities into your SSH Agent from your Keychain.

Remembering to run `ssh-add -A` every time is not a huge imposition, but it seems like the kind of thing you should be able to automate, and thankfully, it is!

=== Automating the Keychain Integration

As well as adding two flags to the `ssh-add` command, Apple also added two additional config directives.

The first of these, `AddKeysToAgent` can be used to automatically load the SSH identities for which there are passphrases in your Keychain into your SSH Agent when you log in to your Mac. This has the same effect as always running `ssh-add -A` after login.

The second, `UseKeychain`, defaults `ssh-add` to always add passphrases to your Keychain when you load them into your SSH Agent. In effect, it turns `ssh-add` into `ssh-add -K`, saving you the need to remember to use the `-K` flag.

To enable one or both of these options, add them to your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):

[source]
----
UseKeychain yes
AddKeysToAgent yes
----

For example, this is what my config file looks like:

[source,console?prompt=%]
----
% cat ~/.ssh/config
# enable integration between Keychain and SSH Agent
UseKeychain yes
AddKeysToAgent yes
% 
----

To make sure you have enabled Keychain integration correctly, log out, log back in again, and open a fresh Terminal window. If everything is working as expected your default identiy should be loaded into your SSH Agent ready for use. You can verify this with `ssh-add -l`, e.g.:

[source,console?prompt=%]
----
% ssh-add -l       
2048 SHA256:rTpb4ShxOt0QzwfFu+SJ5nCIeA99/EUC8WPeYp56WCk /Users/bart/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
%
----

[#Final_Thoughts]
== Final Thoughts

Regardless of your OS, you can make use of an SSH Agent to avoid having to re-enter passwords for SSH identities over and over again.
This is true on all OSes, even Windows.
This is yet another reason to stop using password-less SSH identities -- with an SSH Agent, you can have both security and convenience!

And, for all you Mac users like me who were cranky at the loss of the automated integration between the Keychain and the SSH Agent in macOS Sierra, you've now got a robust and supported fix.
