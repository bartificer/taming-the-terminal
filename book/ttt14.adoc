include::variables.adoc[]

In <<ttt13,the previous instalment>>, we looked at how to make permanent changes to our environment.
We made a permanent change to the `PATH` environment variable to demonstrate how it's done
(by editing `~/.bash_profile` on a Mac,
or `~/.bashrc` on Linux).
In this instalment we'll look at two other kinds of environment changes you may wish to make by editing these files -- specifically, aliases, and custom prompts.

== Aliases

Aliases are basically command shortcuts.
When used as a command, the alias gets expanded to a longer string by Bash before execution.
Aliases can contain arguments as well as commands.
Aliases can be used to create short mnemonics for long complex commands or to add default arguments to existing commands.

Let's start with an example of the first kind.
The command `ls -l` often results in very long output, so it would be nice to be able to automatically run this output through a pager so we can see it one page at a time instead of having to scroll back up to find the start of the output.
As we'll learn in the next instalment, you can do this using the `|` (pronounced '`pipe`') operator.
To run the output of `ls -l` through `less` the command is:

[source,shell]
----
ls -l | less
----

Let's create a short alias for this command, `ll`:

[source,shell]
----
alias ll='ls -l | less'
----

As you can see, you create an alias using the `alias` command.
The bit before the `=` is the shortcut, and the bit after the `=` is what it will expand into.
If the expansion contains spaces or other special characters then either the entire replacement needs to be quoted, or each special character needs to be escaped.
The vast majority of aliases you create will contain spaces and/or at least one special character, so it's best to get into the habit of always quoting your aliases.
In the above example, both the spaces and the `|` would need to be escaped, so the un-quoted version of the above alias would be the following difficult to read mess:

[source,shell]
----
alias ll=ls\ -l\ \|\ less
----

Another common use of aliases is to add default arguments to existing commands.
Let's look at two common examples of this.

By default, the `ls` command does not clearly distinguish the types of the items it lists.
`ls -F` makes things quite a bit clearer by adding a trailing `/` to all folders in the listing, and `-G` makes things even clearer still by using colours to distinguish different types of files (remember that on Linux it's `--color` rather than `-G`).
To have `ls` always show trailing slashes and use colours we can alias `ls` to `ls -FG` (or `ls -F --color` on Linux):

[source,shell]
----
alias ls='ls -FG'
----

Secondly, we can use aliases to make commands that might unintentionally remove or override files behave in a safer manner by automatically adding the `-i` flag to `rm`, `cp` & `mv`:

[source,shell]
----
alias rm='rm -i' cp='cp -i' mv='mv -i'
----

Note that you can use the `alias` command to add multiple aliases at once.
If you set these aliases then `rm`, `cp`, and `mv` will ask for your permission before deleting or overriding a file.
If you're manipulating many files at once this will get tedious, so remember that even if you do this, you can over-ride the `-i` by adding a `-f` (for force) to the commands.
This means you have to be explicit about deleting or overriding files, instead of the commands implicitly assuming you are happy to have the files destroyed.

To see a list of all currently defined aliases, simply run the `alias` command without any arguments:

ifndef::backend-epub3[]
[source,console?prompt=bart$,linenums]
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-epub3[]
[source,console?prompt=bart$]
endif::[]
----
bart-imac2013:~ bart$ alias
alias cp='cp -i'
alias ll='ls -l | less'
alias ls='ls -FG'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias rm='rm -i'
bart-imac2013:~ bart$
----

To remove an alias, use the `unalias` command with the shortcut to be removed as an argument.
E.g.
to remove our `ll` alias, run:

[source,shell]
----
unalias ll
----

Aliases are part of the Bash environment and are not persistent.
If you create an alias and then close your command shell it will be gone.
To make aliases permanent we need to add them into our Bash startup scripts.
As we learned in the previous instalment, for Mac users that means adding our aliases to `~/.bash_profile`, while Linux users should add their aliases to `~/.bashrc`.

If we include the examples from the previous instalment an updated `~/.bash_profile` file to include the `ll` alias would look something like:

ifndef::backend-epub3[]
[source,shell,linenums]
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-epub3[]
[source,shell]
endif::[]
----
# print warning message (leave out the echo lines if you prefer)
echo "NOTE – applying customisations in ~/.bash_profile"
echo " If you make a mistake and need to remove the customisations"
echo " execute the following then restart your Terminal:"
echo " /bin/mv ~/.bash_profile ~/bash_profile.disabled"

# update the path
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/myScripts"

# create our aliases
alias ll='ls -l | less'
alias ls='ls -FG'
alias rm='rm -i' cp='cp -i' mv='mv -i'
----

== Customising the BashPrompt

As we discussed right back in the first instalment, the format of your command prompt varies from system to system.
This variation is not just between command shells, but also within command shells, because many allow customisations to the format of the prompt.
Bash is one of the command shells that support command prompt customisation.

In BASH, the format of the prompt is defined in the shell variable `PS1`.
You can see the current format used with the command:

[source,shell]
----
echo $PS1
----

On OS X the default value of `PS1` is `\h:\W \u\$`, giving prompts that look like:

[source,console?prompt=bart$]
----
bart-imac2013:~ bart$
----

On the RedHat and CentOS variants of Linus the default is `[\u@\h \W]\$`, which give prompts that look like:

[source,console?prompt=$]
----
[bart@www ~]$
----

From the above, you should be able to deduce that any letter in the code prefixed with a `\` is replaced with a value.
Below is a list of some of the variables at your disposal:

* `\h` -- your computer's hostname (e.g.
`bart-imac2013`)
* `\H` -- your computer's FQDN, or fully qualified domain name (e.g.
`bart-imac2013.localdomain`)
* `\d` -- the current date
* `\t` -- the current time in 24 hour HH:MM:SS format
* `\T` -- the current time in 12 hour HH:MM:SS format
* `\@` -- the current time in 12 hour am/pm format
* `\A` -- the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
* `\u` -- the username of the current user
* `\w` -- the complete path of the present working directory (`$HOME` abbreviated to `~`)
* `\W` -- the current folder, i.e.
the last part of the print working directory (`$HOME` abbreviated to `~`)
* `\$` -- if running as root a `#` symbol, otherwise, a `$` symbol
* `\n` -- a new line (yes, your prompt can span multiple lines if you like)

As an example, let's create a very descriptive Bash prompt:

[source,shell]
----
PS1='\d \t - \u@\H:\w\n\$ '
----

Like with any shell variable, any changes we made to `PS1` are confined to our current command shell.
Opening a new Terminal window will restore `PS1` to its default value.
If we want to make the change permanent, we need to add it to our bash startup file (`~/.bash_profile` on OS X or `~/.bashrc` on Linux).

A `~/.bash_profile` file setting all the customisations we've discussed in this instalment and the previous instalment would look like:

ifndef::backend-epub3[]
[source,shell,linenums]
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-epub3[]
[source,shell]
endif::[]
----
# print warning message (leave out the echo lines if you prefer)
echo "NOTE – applying customisations in ~/.bash_profile"
echo " If you make a mistake and need to remove the customisations"
echo " execute the following then restart your Terminal:"
echo " /bin/mv ~/.bash_profile ~/bash_profile.disabled"

# update the path
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/myScripts"

# create our aliases
alias ll='ls -l | less'
alias ls='ls -FG'
alias rm='rm -i' cp='cp -i' mv='mv -i'

# set a custom prompt
PS1='\d \t – \u@\H:\w\n\$ ';
----

Personally, I like to keep my prompts set to their default values -- it helps me recognise the OS I'm on at a glance.

== Conclusions

Over the past few instalments, we have looked at what the shell environment is, how we can manipulate shell and environment variables and aliases.
We looked at two variables in particular, `PATH` and `PS1`.
We also discussed Bash aliases, and how to make permanent changes to your Bash environment, allowing you to customise your PATH and prompt and define aliases.

This is where we'll leave the concept of the environment for now.
In the next instalment, we'll move on to look at what I jokingly call '`plumbing`' -- how commands can be chained together, and how files can be used for input to and output from commands.
